    <ul>
        <li>This link will download the application (APK)</li>
        <li>Once it's done go to your download and click on app-release-0.0.1.apk</li>
        <li>This will install the application</li>
        <li>If you get a warning message saying something like "Blocked by Play Protect" or "Play protect doesn't recognise this app's developer"</li>
        <li>Click the Install anyway button</li>
        <li>That warning message is normal since you haven't download the application from the Google Play store and Planitou app hasn't completed the verification process yet...</li>
